Q6 - What benefits come with using GIT ? 

ANS - Version Control: Git tracks changes to files over time, allowing users to revert to previous versions, review changes, and collaborate effectively.

Branching and Merging: Git supports branching, enabling users to work on separate features or experiments without affecting the main codebase. Changes can be merged back together seamlessly.

Collaboration: Git facilitates collaboration among developers by providing tools for sharing code, reviewing changes, and resolving conflicts.

Backup and Recovery: Git serves as a backup system, storing multiple versions of files and reducing the risk of data loss due to mistakes or corruptions.


Q7 - What is a git repository ? 

ANS - A Git repository is a storage location where a project's files and their entire version history are stored. It contains all the files and directories associated with the project, along with metadata about changes, such as commit messages, timestamps, and author information.

ANS - Open a Terminal or Command Prompt: Navigate to the directory where you want to initialize the repository.

Use the git init Command: Type git init and press Enter. This command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

Verify Initialization: You'll see a message confirming that the repository has been initialized, and a hidden .git directory will be created in the directory.
